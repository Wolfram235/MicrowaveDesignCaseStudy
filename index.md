# HCI Project 1 : Microwave Design Case study 


## Objective

To learn, understand and design a microwave interface by using the microwave in your apartment as an example and improve on its design.
The purpose of this project is to give us some practice with the material in the design of everyday things.
We use microwaves everyday. They have various designs for user controls but not all of them are designed at the best for users.

## Issues with the current design
	1. Controls are not intuitive :
 		 For a first time user who does not know how to operate a microwave the order in which you press the buttons in order to turn the microwave on is not very intuitive, in other words it is not beginner friendly.
	2. Button is flush and no sign :
	The button to open the microwave is almost flush with the control panel with no idications of it to be pressed for opening the door.
	3. Does not warn about the contents being hot after microwaving : 
	A warning sign that says the contents are hot after microwaving should be given, just as a subtle visual  hint to user.
	4. Does not show how to make it work :
	
	5. Hard time changing power :
	There is no direct way to control the power, even if you figure out the power controls it displays them as P1, P2... P10. Most cooking instructions mention the power levels in Watts, showing the power levels in terms of levels is not very intuitive
	6. Microwave details hidden :
	There are different microwaves with different wattage. Some food need a higher wattage microwave inorder to be cooked well. For this the details of the microwave or atleast its power should be shown to the user.
	7. Microwave gets locked :
	Some microwave have locks that get activated when you press the start button too many times. This seems like a child lock. If the elock gets activated the display goes blank, other than a very tiny symbol at the bottom of the microwave. This should be shownn to the user in a more proper way to make them aware that the microwave is locked.
	8. How much time to set for what cooking time
	
	9. What utensils you cannot put inside
	10. Turntable to put back??
	11. No cleaning instructions
