# HCI Project 1 : Microwave Design Case study 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Wolfram235/MicrowaveDesignCaseStudy/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

## Objective

To learn, understand and design a microwave interface by using the microwave in your apartment as an example and improve on its design.
The purpose of this project is to give us some practice with the material in the design of everyday things.
We use microwaves everyday. They have various designs for user controls but not all of them are designed at the best for users.

## Issues with the current design
	1. Controls are not intuitive :
  The number pad is just 
	2. Button is flush and no sign 
	3. Does not warn about the contents being hot after microwaving
	4. Does not show how to make it work
	5. Hard time changing power 
	6. Microwave details hidden
	7. Microwave gets locked 
	8. How much time to set for what cooking time
	9. What utensils you cannot put inside
	10. Turntable to put back??
	11. No cleaning instructions



Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
